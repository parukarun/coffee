            <p>A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of
                intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of
                coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible
                increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by
                poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.</p>

        <h2 class="types">Types</h2>
        <p class="ptypes">Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee
            trees from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging
            from shrubs to trees.</p>
        <ul class="ultype">
            <li>
                <strong>Type of bean.</strong>There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and
                Robusta. Arabica
                originates
                from
                Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide.
                However,
                it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade,
                humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more
                economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures
                between 65-97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in
                rainfall and strong sunlight.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Type of roast.</strong>Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high
                heat to produce a chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor that we associate with coffee.
                They are then cooled and ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The
                lighter the roast, the lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity. Dark roasts
                produce a black bean with little acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular French roast is
                medium-dark.
            </li><br>
            <li><strong>Type of grind.</strong> A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee
                makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarse
                grind is used in coffee presses.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Decaffeinated coffee.</strong> This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side
                effects from caffeine. The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee is to apply
                chemical solvents (methylene chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas. Both are applied to
                steamed or soaked beans, which are then allowed to dry. The solvents bind to caffeine and both evaporate
                when the beans are rinsed and/or dried. According to U.S. regulations, at least 97% of the caffeine must
                be removed to carry the decaffeinated label, so there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both
                methods may cause some loss of flavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in coffee beans that impart
                their unique flavor and scent may be destroyed during processing.

                <h3>1. Starbucks</h3>
                <p>The brand is not known for sourcing and roasting the best coffee beans. Most of their coffee beans
                    are
                    dark roasted, meaning, they taste bitter. And many consumers, who know their coffee, complain that
                    Starbucks coffee has a distinct burnt taste.</p>

                <h3>2. Dunkin' Doughnuts</h3>
                <p>Dunkin' is not as big a brand as Starbucks but they are second in line in the number of stores. But
                    yes,
                    the coffee Dunkin' offers is surely somewhat superior to Starbucks. For instance, Dunkin' does not
                    have
                    the signature burnt taste in coffee as Starbucks does. The coffee is also cheaper.</p>

                    Owned by McDonald's, McCafe is one of the leading coffee chains in countries like Australia and New
                    Zealand. McCafé enjoys the benefit of having a vast presence (Because let's face it, McDonald's is
                    everywhere!) As McDonald's expands worldwide, there is a decent chance of McCafé doing the same.

                    Peet's coffee is said to be fairly stronger than the coffee Starbucks serves so it might not be for
                    everyone. Peet's has a long history of serving darker roasted Arabica coffee. The coffee supposedly
